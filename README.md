# Go

Is one of the fastest languages, it is statically type, the type is verified at compiling type.

## Formas de ejecuci√≥n de go

- **go run**: It compiles with a temp binary

- **go build**: It just compile the file, it produces an executable

- **go install**: It compiles the package

- **gofmt -w main.go**: Format go code


### Declarations and Operators

*Short declaration :=*

- Only to declare new variables, not reasigment, in that case we use =

- Only inside a function we can use ":=", it simplifies the declaration and inferes data type

**profesion := "engineer"** cant be used in package scope

*Mute unused variable _*
- Mute variable in go, we use _ to say that we are not interested in declaring the value of 
the variable in this moment, but we will use the variable and declare it later, we use _ = varn 
to mute the error of unsued variable.
